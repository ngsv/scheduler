# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a full stack application built with React that allows you to schedule a person for an interview with available interviewers for a selected time and day.

Interview slots are available Monday through Friday, from 12:00pm to 5:00pm and each interview has a duration of one hour. The left side panel lets you choose the day of the week, and displays the number of interview slots remaining for the day. The application shows the schedule for the day, and you can create a new interview, and edit or delete any scheduled interviews.

React was used for single page functionality, Axios to fetch data from the API, and testing was done using Storybook, Jest, and Cypress.
